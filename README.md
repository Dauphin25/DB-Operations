# TABLE BOOKS
starting in ***sqlite3***, i created ***Library*** database with Table ***books*** and practiced  little bit

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## INTRODUCTION

I write this code to practice in ***sqlite3***. You can write commands ***in console***. Program checks if the command is correct
executes it, and writes them in ***commands_history.txt***
I have also ***output.txt*** file statements in this case.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DAUPHIN25/DB-Operations.git


## NOTE on 'sqlite3'

The ***'sqlite3'*** module is part of the Python standard library and does not need to be explicitly 
listed in the ***'requirements.txt'*** file. It is included with every standard Python
installation, and users don't need to install it separately.
